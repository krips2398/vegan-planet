# Introduction


In 2019, the Study of Current and Former Vegetarians and Vegans was conducted by Faunalytics. This study sought to investigate the factors that influence current and former vegans and vegetarians to adopt a plant-based diet and sometimes give up their diets. In a report written by Animal Charity Evaluators, 2-6% of Americans self-identify as vegetarians. In addition, at the time of the report, the percentage of self-identified vegetarians increased substantially between 2013 and 2018.

Given this interesting rise in individuals self-identifying as vegans and/or vegetarians, we were interested in examining potential trends in the opening of plant-based restaurants throughout the country over a certain time period, and uncovering potential relationships between the length of a persons plant-based diet and inconvenience factors, as well what factors could have influenced how long it takes to transition to a vegan or vegetarian diet.
